Leviatha - A Diablo II Database! Items, monsters, character classes, skills, and lots more stuff all at your fingertips!

TODO
    Monsters
        Normalize game monster data and make a landing page / directory for it like /loot/
        
    World
        Will probably just hardcode this stuff (and by stuff, zones, quests, NPCs, etc) maybe links to someone's Diablo wiki
    
    Classes
        Builds will be merged into this section. Need to rip out some class data from the game files
        
    Loot
        Statistical information would be cool to visualize / compare. Add runes / gems / runewords / magic prefix/suffic stuff
